    <h1>
      404 - URL not provided in the app Scully is serving
    </h1>
    <p>
      The url "/test/fake1" is not provided in the scully.routes.json, so it can't be generated
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have routes that are not known before  you might want to serve index.html instead of this response.
      <br>
      That can be done by adding the '--404=index' option to the Scully command
