<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="generator">
    <h1>
      404 - URL not provided in the app Scully is serving
    </h1>
    <p>
      The url "/test/fake1" is not provided in the scully.routes.json, so it can't be generated
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have routes that are not known before  you might want to serve index.html instead of this response.
      <br>
      That can be done by adding the '--404=index' option to the Scully command
      <script>
        /** triggering page ready, as there is no need to wait for a timeout */
          setTimeout(() => window.dispatchEvent(new Event('AngularReady', {
            bubbles: true,
            cancelable: false
          })),10)
      </script>
    </p>
  </head>
</html>
`;
