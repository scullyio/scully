## Syntax Highlighting Using Prismjs

When you are using code blocks in your markdown files for your blog posts, you'll may define a language for the used code like this:

<pre><code>```ts
const foo = 'bar';
```</code></pre>

Scully will parse the markdown using [_marked_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked).
In the end the parsed result will look like this:

```html
<code class="language-ts">
  <span class="token keyword">const</span> foo
  <span class="token operator">=</span>
  <span class="token string">'bar'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code>
```

As you can see _marked_ will use the CSS class prefix `language-` for tagging the code block with the appropriate language.

To highlight your code blocks, you can use [_prismjs_](https://prismjs.com) as it matches with the resulting class names. You can install prismjs using NPM and creating a service to highlight your code blocks:

```bash
npm i --save prismjs
ng g s highlight
```

The service will include all languages you need and probably the clipboard library to simply copy the code etc.

It could look like this:

```ts
import {Injectable, Inject} from '@angular/core';

import {PLATFORM_ID} from '@angular/core';
import {isPlatformBrowser} from '@angular/common';

import 'clipboard';
import 'prismjs';
import 'prismjs/plugins/toolbar/prism-toolbar';
import 'prismjs/plugins/copy-to-clipboard/prism-copy-to-clipboard';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-bash';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-css';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-javascript';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-json';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-markup';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-typescript';
// ... probably more, check out node_modules/prismjs/components

declare var Prism: any;

@Injectable()
export class HighlightService {
  constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) {}

  highlightAll() {
    if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId)) {
      Prism.highlightAll();
    }
  }
}
```

After this, you need the service to be injected in your `BlogComponent` that was generated by scully:

```ts
import {/* ... */, AfterViewChecked} from '@angular/core';
import {HighlightService} from '../highlight.service';
/* ... */
export class BlogComponent implements OnInit, AfterViewChecked {
  constructor(
    /* ... */
    private highlightService: HighlightService
  ) {}
  /* ... */
  ngAfterViewChecked() {
    this.highlightService.highlightAll();
  }
}
```

The last step is to include a theme from prism:

```css
/* include CSS for prism toolbar */
@import '~prismjs/plugins/toolbar/prism-toolbar.css';
/* check node_modules/prismjs/themes/ for the available themes */
@import '~prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow';
```

That's it, all code languages you have been imported in your `HighlightService` should be highlighted now.
