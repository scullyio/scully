## What is Scully?

**Scully** is the best static site generator for Angular projects looking to embrace the JAMStack.

### How does it work?

Under the hood, Scully analyzes an Angular application, and it generates a static version of it. In addition, it is **EASY TO USE** because it provides several Angular schematics.

Scully works on Windows, Linux and macOS.
