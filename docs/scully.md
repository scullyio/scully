# Scully Documentation (Alpha)

## What is Scully?

**Scully** is freaking awesome. Why? Because it can create static sites using Angular.
In other words, **Scully** is a SSG (static site generator) for Angular.

### How does it work?

Under the hood, Scully analyzes your project and generates a static version of your website. Scully provides you with
a few node commands and several Angular schematics to make this all **AS EASY AS POSSIBLE!**

Scully works on Windows, Linux and macOS.
