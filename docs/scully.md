# Scully Documentation (Alpha) 

## What is Scully?

**Scully** is freaking awesome, Why? because we can create static sites using Angular,
so basically **Scully** is a SSG (static site generator) for Angular.  

### How we can do that?

 The magic happens thanks to our node CLI application. We use schematics add simpleness to the entire flow.   
 
 Scully works on Windows, Linux and ~~also even on~~ MacOS.
