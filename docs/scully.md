# Scully Documentation (Alpha) 

## What is Scully?

**Scully** is freaking awesome. Why? Because it can create static sites using Angular.
In other words, **Scully** is a SSG (static site generator) for Angular.  

### How does it work?

Under the hood, Scully analyzes your project and generate a static version of your website. Scully provides you with 
a few node commands and Angular schematics to make this all __AS EASY AS POSSIBLE!__
  
Scully works on Windows, Linux and macOS.
