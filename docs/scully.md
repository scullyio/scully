# Scully Documentation (Alpha) 

## What is Scully?

**Scully** is freaking awesome. Why? Because it can create static sites using Angular.
So basically **Scully** is a SSG (static site generator) for Angular.  

### How does it do it?

The magic happens thanks to its Node.js CLI application. It allows you to use schematics for a simple work flow.
  
Scully works on Windows, Linux and macOS.
