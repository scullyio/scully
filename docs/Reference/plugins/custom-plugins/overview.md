# Building your own plugins

The plugin system allows you to define your own plugins in order to have a fine-grained control over Scully's pre-render process.
There are six main types of plugins, and you can make your own custom plugins off any of those types.

First, [create the plugin function](/docs/Reference/plugins/custom-plugins/create-a-plugin-function.md).

Second, [register a new plugin](/docs/Reference/plugins/custom-plugins/register-a-new-plugin.md).

Finally, [use a custom plugin](/docs/Reference/plugins/custom-plugins/use-a-custom-plugin).
