## Overview

The purpose of the Scully canonical plugin is to take a canonical link attribute from a route and replace the value of the canonical link in the head of a page, or add the link tag if it doesn't exist. This is needed for SEO purposes, if a given article was first published on another site, for example.

## Features

- ✅ Replaces the canonical link with the provided URL for the link tag
- ✅ Adds a canonical link tag if one doesn't exist for a page

## Installation

### NPM

`npm install scully-plugin-canonical --save-dev`

### Yarn

`yarn add scully-plugin-canonical --dev`

## Usage

Render plugins get access to information about the route, and the plugin looks for the title in the following locations in order:

- `route.canonical`
- `route.data.canonical`
- `route.canonicalUrl`
- `route.data.canonicalUrl`
- `route.canonical_url`
- `route.data.canonical_url`

> If the canonical url is set in the frontmatter of a markdown file, the attribute shows up on `route.data`.

To use this plugin, you need to just require the package inside the Scully `config.ts` for your project, i.e. `scully.your-project-name.config.ts`. After requiring the plugin, add it to the `defaultPostRenderers` array for the site:

```ts
// scully.your-project-name.config.ts
require('scully-plugin-canonical');

export const config: ScullyConfig = {
  projectRoot: './src',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
  outDir: './dist/static',
  routes: {},
  defaultPostRenderers: ['setCanonicalLinkPlugin']
};
```

If you only want it to be added to some routes, add it like this:

```ts
// scully.your-project-name.config.ts
require('scully-plugin-canonical');

export const config: ScullyConfig = {
  ...
  routes: {
    '/blog/:slug': {
      type: 'contentFolder',
      slug: {
        folder: './blog'
      },
      postRenderers: ['setCanonicalLinkPlugin']
    }
  }
  ...
};
```

That's all it takes for the plugin to be included and run on the pages in your app.
