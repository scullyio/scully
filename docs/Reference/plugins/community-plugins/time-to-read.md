The `scully-plugin-time-to-read` is a `routeProcess` plugin for [Scully](http://scully.io/) that processes a specific route and will add the 'readingTime' property to the `RouteData. This property reflects the time that people need to read the content.

This plugin is designed (and test) to work with the blog schematic and the contentFolder plugin. 

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install this plugin with `npm` run

```
$ npm install scully-plugin-time-to-read --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add the folowing configuration to your scully config: 

```typescript
// scully.config.ts
setPluginConfig(timeToRead, {
  path: '<THE PATH TO YOUR ROUTES>'
} as timeToReadOptions);

```
You can now use the `RouteData` and get the `readingTime` property in your component.
To get the routes you can use the `ScullyRoutesService` and pass the route with data to your component.

Below a example of how you can use the `readingTime` property in your component.

```html
      <mat-card-subtitle>
        Date: {{ route?.data?.date | date: 'dd-MM-yyyy' }} - {{ route?.data?.readingTime | number:'1.0-0'}} min read
      </mat-card-subtitle>
```
