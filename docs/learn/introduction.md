# Introduction

## What is Scully?

Scully is the best static site generator for Angular projects looking to embrace the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/).  
Scully works on Windows, Linux and macOS.

## How does it work?

Scully analyzes the route structure of your compiled Angular application and generates a static version of each page.

## How do I use it?

Scully provides a number of utilities to manipulate static pages, such as:

- [Render .md files as .html](/docs/learn/create-a-blog/add-blog-support) and [extract data from generated routes](/docs/learn/create-a-blog/use-blog-post-data-in-template) to use in Angular templates via simple observable.
- A [flexible and extensible plugin system](/docs/learn/plugins/overview) to bake your own functionality into Scully's processes.
- Several [Angular schematics](/docs/learn/schematics/create-scully-files-with-ng-add) to make its usage <strong>as easy as possible!</strong>
